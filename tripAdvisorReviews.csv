2,The location is great but they don't warn you about the train that is two blocks away and passes through every 45 minutes all night long.  It blows its whistle every time through.  They offer free ear plugs at the front desk but they are...More

Cons:

3,"Ahh, the historic Monte Vista!  We spent 2 nights there, in two different rooms, no less.  On the first night we were in the Cornel Wilde room.  Small, a little cramped, and a bathroom designed for munchkins.  But it was clean.  We were on the...More"
